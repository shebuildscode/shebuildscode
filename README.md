# Hi, I'm shebuilds.code ✨

**Junior web developer** learning through building real projects.

I believe in building applications from scratch to make sure I understand the logic behind every line of code. My primary strength is frontend, where I enjoy the process of breaking things and fixing them until they work perfectly. My goal is to write clean, functional code and consistently improve my problem-solving skills.

## 🛠️ About Projects

**All projects are built from scratch.**

These projects represent authentic learning - no copy-paste,
no tutorials followed blindly, no AI-generated solutions.
Every feature, every bug fix, every design decision is mine.

Each project represents genuine hands-on learning:

- Reading documentation
- Debugging independently
- Iterating on solutions
- Learning from mistakes
- Understanding every line of code written
